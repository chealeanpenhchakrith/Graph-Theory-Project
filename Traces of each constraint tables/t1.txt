The number of vertices is :  15 (after adding 2 fictional tasks 0 and 14 )

The number of edges is :  18

The graph in form of triplets is :

0 -> 1 = 0
0 -> 2 = 0
1 -> 3 = 2
2 -> 4 = 5
3 -> 4 = 4
13 -> 4 = 9
4 -> 5 = 2

7 -> 8 = 9
8 -> 9 = 2
11 -> 10 = 1
4 -> 11 = 2
3 -> 12 = 4
6 -> 13 = 5
12 -> 13 = 1
9 -> 14 = 5
10 -> 14 = 1

The adjacency matrix is :

* Detecting a cycle 

* Method of eliminating entry points : 

The current source vertice is : [0]
The vertice list before elimination looks like : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

Selected entry points = [0]
