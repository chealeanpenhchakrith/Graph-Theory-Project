#############################  Table : 12  ################################

The number of vertices is :  14 (after adding 2 fictional tasks 0 and 13 )

The number of edges is :  23

The graph in form of triplets is :

0 -> 1 = 0
0 -> 2 = 0
1 -> 3 = 10
2 -> 3 = 10
10 -> 3 = 12
1 -> 4 = 10
2 -> 4 = 10
4 -> 5 = 5
5 -> 6 = 4
4 -> 7 = 5
5 -> 8 = 4
7 -> 8 = 2
9 -> 8 = 8
3 -> 9 = 9
4 -> 9 = 5
9 -> 10 = 8
6 -> 11 = 2
8 -> 11 = 4
10 -> 11 = 12
1 -> 12 = 10
6 -> 12 = 2
11 -> 13 = 2
12 -> 13 = 20

The adjacency matrix is :

* Detecting a cycle 

* Method of eliminating entry points : 

The current source vertice is : [0]
The vertice list before elimination looks like : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

Selected entry points = [0]
