#############################  Table : 14  ################################

The number of vertices is :  6 (after adding 2 fictional tasks 0 and 5 )

The number of edges is :  7

The graph in form of triplets is :

0 -> 1 = 0
0 -> 2 = 0
1 -> 3 = 3
2 -> 3 = 2
4 -> 3 = 1
2 -> 4 = 2
3 -> 5 = 4

The adjacency matrix is :

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| . | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 0 | . | 0 | 0 | . | . | . |

* Detecting a cycle 

* Method of eliminating entry points : 

The current source vertice is : [0]
The vertice list before elimination looks like : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Selected entry points = [0]
Eliminating entry points [0]...
The current list of remaining vertices is : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Remaining sources vertices : [1, 2]

Selected entry points = [1]
Eliminating entry points [1]...
The current list of remaining vertices is : [2, 3, 4, 5].
Remaining sources vertices : [2]

Selected entry points = [2]
Eliminating entry points [2]...
The current list of remaining vertices is : [3, 4, 5].
Remaining sources vertices : [4]

Selected entry points = [4]
Eliminating entry points [4]...
The current list of remaining vertices is : [3, 5].
Remaining sources vertices : [3]

Selected entry points = [3]
Eliminating entry points [3]...
The current list of remaining vertices is : [5].
Remaining sources vertices : [5]

Selected entry points = [5]
Eliminating entry points [5]...
Remaining vertices : None
Method of eliminating vertices finished

There is no cycle and no negative edges thus : âœ… The graph is a valid scheduling graph.  Proceeding with scheduling calculation...


ðŸ“Š Ranks of the vertices:

Task 0: Rank 0
Task 1: Rank 1
Task 2: Rank 1
Task 3: Rank 3
Task 4: Rank 2
Task 5: Rank 4
