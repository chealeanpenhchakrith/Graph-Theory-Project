#############################  Table : 11  ################################

The number of vertices is :  10 (after adding 2 fictional tasks 0 and 9 )

The number of edges is :  16

The graph in form of triplets is :

0 -> 1 = 0
1 -> 2 = 1
4 -> 2 = 2
2 -> 3 = 1
1 -> 4 = 1
5 -> 4 = 5
1 -> 5 = 1
4 -> 6 = 2
5 -> 6 = 5
3 -> 7 = 4
5 -> 7 = 5
2 -> 8 = 1
4 -> 8 = 2
6 -> 8 = 6
7 -> 8 = 3
8 -> 9 = 0

The adjacency matrix is :

* Detecting a cycle 

* Method of eliminating entry points : 

The current source vertice is : [0]
The vertice list before elimination looks like : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Method of eliminating vertices finished

There is no cycle and no negative edges thus : âœ… The graph is a valid scheduling graph.  Proceeding with scheduling calculation...
